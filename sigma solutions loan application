Along with approving lower credit borrowers, Capital Good Fund's major perk is its Financial Coaching Department. Each customer will be assigned a financial coach and will receive one-on-one coaching and advice.

There are two programs currently available: Financial Coaching Plus and its Credit Builder Program. Coaching Plus helps borrowers reach their financial goals by creating a personalized financial action plan and Credit Builder focuses specifically on growing credit.

As an added bonus, borrowers enrolled in either program will be given the option to make a small monthly payment directly to Capital. Capital will then report the payments to all three credit bureaus, which can help increase your score.
