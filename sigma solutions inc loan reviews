Prosper is a peer-to-peer lender that has a low credit minimum requirement of 600 and allows its borrowers to apply with a co-borrower. Prosper has more stringent financial requirements than Capital, but also caters its personal loans to borrowers with a lower credit score. If you're looking to finance a specific emergency expense, a Capital Good Fund loan should be the first option due to its lower interest rates and minimal eligibility requirements.
Capital Good Fund vs. Upstart

Upstart is similar to Capital Good Fund in that it caters to borrowers with bad credit scores. It allows applicants to apply even without a credit score.

While Upstart does have more financial requirements and a higher APR maximum than a Capital loan, one of its loans may fare better for users with lower credit who need a larger balance.
